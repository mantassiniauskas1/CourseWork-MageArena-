# CourseWork
 
 This was a course work that I did for my Object-oriented programming subject in my 2nd semester as a software developing student. 
 I wasn't permitted to use a game engine or any other game development tools.
 
 
 Tutorial
 
 Move the character using WASD
 To select a spell, use 1-4 number keys (not numpad, the ones above the letters)
 Cast a spell by holding left mouse button after selecting an existing spell combination
 
 Spell combinations:
    Fireball = Air + Fire
    Big boulder = Air + Earth
    More spells coming soon!
